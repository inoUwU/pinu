## ✍️ Commit Message Format

```

<type>(<scope>)\<optional !>: <description>

\[optional body]

\[optional footer(s)]

````

- The message must start with a **type** (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.).
- A **scope** may be included in parentheses.
- If the commit includes a breaking change, **`!`** must be added before the colon.
- A **description** must follow after a colon and a space.

## ✅ Examples

```

## 📌 Common commit types and gitmoji

Use these types and emojis for commit messages. Each type should be used according to the change's intent.

## 🔒 Enforcement (Optional)

To enforce Conventional Commits automatically, consider using:

- [`commitlint`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
- [`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky)

These tools help prevent invalid commit messages during local development or CI workflows.
